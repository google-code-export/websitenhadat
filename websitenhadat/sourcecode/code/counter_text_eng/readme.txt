The Counter needs no database.

For installaion, you need to copy counter.txt, counter.gif und counter.php in your directory.

Now you can include the counter via

<? include "counter.php"; ?>

in your website.

When your website is running in different directories, you need to set the path to the counter.txt file in the top of the counter.php

Do not forget to set the file rights (chmod)

The links within the script are not allowed to remove. You can remove them after paying a little fee. For more Information, have a look at http://www.vonderborn.com/php_counter_script_eng.php
